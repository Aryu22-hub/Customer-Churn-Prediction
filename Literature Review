# **Literature Review: Customer Churn Prediction**

## **1. Introduction**
In subscription-based businesses, customer churn prediction is a crucial aspect of customer relationship management (CRM). Researchers in this field are exploring the use of machine learning, statistical models, and feature engineering techniques to identify at-risk customers and develop proactive retention strategies.

This literature review delves into key methodologies, models, and insights gained from recent studies on customer churn prediction.

## **2. Existing Research & Approaches**

### **2.1 Traditional Statistical Models**
- **Logistic Regression:** One of the earliest and most widely used approaches for churn prediction due to its interpretability and efficiency. Studies (e.g., Lemmens & Croux, 2006) have demonstrated its effectiveness when applied to structured customer data, such as demographics and purchase history.
- **Survival Analysis:** Used to estimate the time until a customer churns. Research (Wei & Tanner, 1990) suggests that survival models are particularly useful for developing long-term customer retention strategies.

### **2.2 Machine Learning-Based Approaches**
- **Decision Tree Classifiers (Random Forest, XGBoost, LightGBM):** These ensemble models have been shown to improve churn prediction performance by effectively handling feature interactions, outperforming logistic regression. XGBoost, in particular, has gained popularity due to its high accuracy in structured data (Chen & Guestrin, 2016).
- **Deep Learning Models (Neural Networks, LSTMs):** Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTMs) have been employed to predict churn based on sequential user interactions. However, these models face challenges in terms of interpretability and require large datasets for effective training.

### **2.3 Feature Engineering & Data Preprocessing**
- Feature selection is a crucial step in enhancing prediction accuracy. Engagement-based features, such as login frequency and transaction patterns, have been shown to significantly improve model performance (Lemmens & Gupta, 2013).
- Addressing data imbalance, particularly the rarity of churn events, is crucial. Techniques such as **SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique)** and **cost-sensitive learning** have been proposed to mitigate this issue (Han et al., 2005).
- Moving on to clustering techniques for customer segmentation, clustering helps identify high-risk customer segments before they churn. **K-Means and DBSCAN** are widely used algorithms for grouping customers based on their purchasing behavior and churn likelihood (Saravanan & Subramaniyaswamy, 2019).
- Furthermore, studies have explored the use of **autoencoder-based clustering** for unsupervised learning in churn detection (Gupta et al., 2020).

## **3. Evaluation Metrics in Churn Prediction**
To ensure the reliability of churn prediction models, they are evaluated using several metrics. These include:
- **AUC-ROC Curve:** Measures the model’s ability to differentiate between churners and non-churners.
- **Precision and Recall:** Particularly important in cases of class imbalance, as false negatives can be costly.
- **F1-Score:** Balances precision and recall, ensuring that the model makes effective predictions.
- **SHAP Values:** Used for interpretability in complex models, such as XGBoost.

## **4. Challenges and Future Directions**

### **Challenges:**
- **Data Quality:** Missing values and inconsistent customer interaction records.
- **Model Interpretability:** Advanced models, such as deep learning, are often “black boxes,” making it difficult to understand their decision-making processes.
- **Real-Time Predictions:** Businesses require fast and scalable solutions for real-time churn prevention.

### **Future Research:**
- **Hybrid Models:** Combining machine learning (ML) and deep learning techniques to achieve better accuracy.
- **Explainable AI (XAI):** Developing methods to improve the interpretability of AI models, making them more understandable to business stakeholders.
- **Real-Time Churn Prediction:** Integrating streaming analytics with ML models to enable real-time churn prediction.

Research underscores the significance of **feature engineering, model interpretability, and real-time analytics** in enhancing predictive accuracy and business impact.

This literature review serves as a solid foundation for developing an effective churn prediction model. Future research will involve implementing these techniques and assessing their effectiveness in a real-world dataset.
